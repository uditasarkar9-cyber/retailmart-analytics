-- PURPOSE: Operations Analytics — Delivery, Returns, Payments + Support + Call Center
-- AUTHOR: Sayyed Siraj Ali
-- VERSION: 2.0 (RetailMart V2)
-- DATABASE: accio_retailmart_clean (PostgreSQL 18)
--
-- V2 CHANGES:
--   - total_amount → net_total
--   - full_name → first_name || ' ' || last_name
--   - c.city → from customers.addresses (default)
--   - p.category → via dim_brand → dim_category JOIN chain
--   - p.prod_id → p.product_id
--   - NEW: 5 views for support tickets and call center analytics
--
-- CREATES: 10 Views + 1 MV + 7 JSON Functions
