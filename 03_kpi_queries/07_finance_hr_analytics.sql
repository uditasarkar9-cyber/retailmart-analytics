-- PURPOSE: Finance & HR Analytics — Expenses, P&L, Attendance, Salary, Payroll
-- AUTHOR: Sayyed Siraj Ali
-- VERSION: 2.0 (RetailMart V2) — 🆕 NEW MODULE
-- DATABASE: accio_retailmart_clean (PostgreSQL 18)
--
-- DESCRIPTION:
--   Every CFO wants to know: "Are we profitable? Where's the money going?"
--   Every HR head asks: "Who's showing up? What's our payroll burden?"
--
--   This module combines finance and HR into one dashboard tab:
--   - Expense tracking by category and trends
--   - Revenue vs Expense (P&L)
--   - Budget tracking and overspend detection
--   - Employee attendance patterns
--   - Salary analysis by department/role
--   - Payroll cost breakdown with tax analysis
--
-- SOURCE TABLES:
--   finance.expenses, finance.revenue_summary, core.dim_expense_category,
--   hr.attendance, hr.salary_history, payroll.pay_slips, payroll.tax_brackets,
--   stores.employees, core.dim_department
