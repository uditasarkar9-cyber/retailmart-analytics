-- PROJECT: RetailMart V2 Enterprise Analytics Platform
-- PURPOSE: Sales Analytics Module — Complete sales performance tracking
-- AUTHOR: Sayyed Siraj Ali
-- VERSION: 2.0 (RetailMart V2)
-- DATABASE: accio_retailmart_clean (PostgreSQL 18)
--
-- DESCRIPTION:
--   This is the heart of retail analytics. Every Monday morning at Flipkart,
--   Amazon, or BigBasket, leadership asks: "How did we do last week?"
--   
--   This module answers:
--   - How much revenue did we generate? (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly)
--   - Are we growing or declining? (MoM, QoQ, YoY comparisons)
--   - What payment methods do customers prefer?
--   - Weekend vs Weekday performance?
--   - What are the trends? (Moving averages)
--
-- V2 CHANGES:
--   - orders.total_amount → orders.net_total / orders.gross_total
--   - order_items.discount (%) → order_items.discount_amount (absolute ₹)
--   - vw_hourly_sales_pattern → replaced with vw_sales_by_order_status
--     (order_date is DATE in V2, no hourly data)
--
-- CREATES:
--   • 8 Regular Views  
--   • 2 Materialized Views  
--   • 8 JSON Export Functions
--
-- EXECUTION ORDER: Run AFTER 02_data_quality scripts
