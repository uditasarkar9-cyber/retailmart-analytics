-- PROJECT: RetailMart V2 Enterprise Analytics Platform
-- PURPOSE: Customer Analytics Module — CLV, RFM, Cohort, Churn + Loyalty
-- AUTHOR: Sayyed Siraj Ali
-- VERSION: 2.0 (RetailMart V2)
-- DATABASE: accio_retailmart_clean (PostgreSQL 18)
--
-- DESCRIPTION:
--   "Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning" — Bill Gates
--   
--   This module helps answer:
--   - Who are our most valuable customers? (CLV Analysis)
--   - How should we segment customers? (RFM Analysis)
--   - Are we retaining customers? (Cohort Retention)
--   - Who is about to leave? (Churn Prediction)
--   - Where are our customers? (Geography via addresses)
--   - How is the loyalty program performing? (NEW in V2)
--
-- V2 CHANGES:
--   - full_name → first_name || ' ' || last_name
--   - gender/age/region_name/city/state REMOVED from customers table
--   - join_date → registration_date
--   - Location data from customers.addresses (via default address)
--   - total_amount → net_total
--   - loyalty_points.total_points → SUM(loyalty_points.points_earned)
--   - vw_customer_demographics → replaced with vw_customer_registration_trends
--   - NEW: 3 loyalty views (tier distribution, redemption patterns, ROI)
--
-- CREATES:
--   • 7 Regular Views (4 updated + 3 new loyalty)
--   • 3 Materialized Views
--   • 7 JSON Export Functions
--
-- EXECUTION ORDER: Run AFTER 01_sales_analytics.sql
