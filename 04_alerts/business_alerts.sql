-- PROJECT: RetailMart V2 Enterprise Analytics Platform
-- PURPOSE: Business Alerts — Automated monitoring and anomaly detection
-- AUTHOR: Sayyed Siraj Ali
-- VERSION: 2.0 (RetailMart V2)
-- DATABASE: accio_retailmart_clean (PostgreSQL 18)
--
-- V2 CHANGES:
--   - stock_qty → quantity_on_hand, product_name, product_id
--   - full_name → first_name || ' ' || last_name
--   - total_amount → net_total
--   - category via JOIN chain
--   - NEW: API degradation, error spike, suspicious changes, low attendance, production quality
--
-- DEPENDENCY: Must run AFTER all 03_kpi_queries/ scripts
--   (references mv_customer_lifetime_value, vw_audit_*, vw_production_*)
--
-- CREATES: 12 Alert Views + 1 Consolidated View + 1 JSON Function
